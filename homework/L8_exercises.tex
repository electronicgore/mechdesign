Here $\theta$ is the seller's valuation of the item, and the buyer's valuation is given by $v(\theta) > \theta$. The buyer designs a direct revelation mechanism $(k,t)$ to purchase this item, where $k(\theta)$ is the probability of trade and $t(\theta)$ is the payment from the buyer to the seller.\footnote{Note the sign of transfers is flipped to how we usually model them.} Players' expected utilities given seller's true type $\theta$ and seller's report $\hat{\theta}$ are then given by	\begin{align*}		U^S(\hat{\theta}|\theta) &= -\theta k(\hat{\theta}) + t(\hat{\theta}),		\\		U^B(\hat{\theta}|\theta) &= v(\theta) k(\hat{\theta}) - t(\hat{\theta}).	\end{align*}	\begin{enumerate}		\item Show that for an allocation rule $k(\theta)$ to be BIC, it must be weakly \emph{decreasing} in $\theta$.		\item BIC ERP can be written for this problem as $U^S(\theta|\theta) = U^S(1|1) + \int_{\theta}^{1} k(s) ds $. Using this expression, show that the buyer's expected utility in any BIC DRM $(k,t)$ is given by:		\begin{align*}			\mathbb{E} U^B(\theta | \theta) = \int_0^1 k(\theta) VS(\theta) \phi(\theta) d\theta - U^S(1),		\end{align*}		where $VS(\theta) = v(\theta) - \theta - \frac{F(\theta)}{\phi(\theta)}$.		\item Explain each component of $VS(\theta)$.		\item Find the optimal allocation when $v(\theta) = \frac{3\theta}{2}$ for $\theta \in [0,\frac{1}{3}]$ and $v(\theta) = \frac{5\theta}{2}-\frac{1}{3}$ for $\theta \in [\frac{1}{3},1]$.		\item Find the optimal allocation when $v(\theta) = \frac{5\theta}{2}$ for $\theta \in [0,\frac{1}{3}]$ and $v(\theta) = \frac{3\theta}{2}+\frac{1}{3}$ for $\theta \in [\frac{1}{3},1]$.	\end{enumerate}		\ifsolutions\section*{Solution}\begin{enumerate}	\item Take two arbitrary types $\theta$ and $\hat{\theta}>\theta$. IC condition for $\theta$ to not be willing to falsely report $\hat{\theta}$ is	\begin{align*}		U^S(\theta|\theta) &\geq U^S (\hat{\theta}|\theta)		\\		&\geq -\theta k(\hat{\theta}) + t(\hat{\theta})		\\		&\geq -\hat{\theta} k(\hat{\theta}) + t(\hat{\theta}) + (\hat{\theta}-\theta) k(\hat{\theta})		\\		&\geq U^S (\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta}) + (\hat{\theta}-\theta) k(\hat{\theta})		\\		\iff k(\hat{\theta}) &\leq - \frac{U^S(\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta})-U^S(\theta|\theta)}{\hat{\theta}-\theta}.	\end{align*}	Applying a similar chain of reasoning to the IC condition for $\hat{\theta}$ to not be willing to report $\theta$ yields	\begin{align*}		k({\theta}) &\geq - \frac{U^S(\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta})-U^S(\theta|\theta)}{\hat{\theta}-\theta},	\end{align*}	hence $k(\theta) \geq k(\hat{\theta})$. Types $\theta$ and $\hat{\theta}>\theta$ were arbitrary, hence any implementable $k(\theta)$ must be a weakly decreasing function.			\item The expected utility of the buyer can be written as:		$$ \mathbb{E}U^B(\hat{\theta}|\theta)=\mathbb{E}_\theta[v(\theta)k(\hat{\theta})-t(\hat{\theta})]$$		Rearranging $U^S$ to $t(\theta)=U^S(\hat{\theta}|\theta)+\theta k(\theta)$ and plugging it into the expected utility of the buyer:		$$ \mathbb{E}U^B(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_\theta[v(\theta)k(\theta)-U^S(\theta)-\theta k(\theta)]$$		Now, using the envelope theorem yields:	\begin{align*}		\mathbb{E}U^B(\theta) &=\mathbb{E}_\theta[(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)-U^S(1)-\int_\theta^1k(s)ds]		\\		&=\mathbb{E}_\theta[(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)-\int_\theta^1k(s)ds]-U^S(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1 \left[(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)-\int_\theta^1k(s)ds \right] \phi(\theta)d\theta-U^S(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)\phi(\theta)d\theta  -\int_0^1\int_\theta^1k(s) \phi(\theta) ds d\theta-U^S(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)\phi(\theta)d\theta  -\int_0^1\int_0^\theta k(s) \phi(\theta) d\theta ds-U^S(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)\phi(\theta)d\theta  -\int_0^1 k(s) \left[\int_0^\theta \phi(\theta) d\theta \right] ds-U^S(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1(v(\theta)-\theta)k(\theta)\phi(\theta)d\theta-\int_0^1 k(\theta) F(\theta) d\theta -U^{S}(1)		\\		&=\int_0^1 \left(v(\theta)-\theta-\frac{F(\theta)}{\phi(\theta)} \right) k(\theta)\phi(\theta)d\theta -U^S(1)	\end{align*}			\item 	Explain each component of $VS(\theta)$.		$$ VS(\theta)=v(\theta)-\theta-\frac{F(\theta)}{\phi(\theta)} $$		$VS(\theta)$ is the virtual surplus gained by the buyer in this model. $v(\theta)$ is the buyer's valuation, $\theta$ is the seller's valuation which is equal to the quality of the item which is privately known by the seller. The buyer does not know $\theta$ exactly, but he assumes that $\theta$ is a random variable with some cumulative distribution function $F(\theta)$ and probability distribution function $\phi(\theta)$.		Term $v(\theta) - \theta$ represents the \textbf{surplus} generated by trade, this is what the buyer would maximize if he could extract the information about $\theta$ from the seller at no cost. The term $\frac{F(\theta)}{\phi(\theta)}$ is the \textbf{information rent} that must be left to the seller in order to incentivize truthtelling. The buyer thus maximizes surplus net of information rents.			\item 	Calculate virtual surplus $VS(\theta) = v(\theta) - \theta - \frac{F(\theta)}{f(\theta)}$: 	\begin{align*}		VS(\theta) &= 		\begin{cases}			\frac{3\theta}{2} - \theta - \frac{\theta}{1} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]			\\			\frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{3} - \theta - \frac{\theta}{1} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]		\end{cases}		\\		\Leftrightarrow		VS(\theta) &= 		\begin{cases}			-\frac{\theta}{2} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]			\\			\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{3} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]		\end{cases}	\end{align*}	Pointwise optimization prescribes setting $k(\theta) = 1$ if $VS(\theta) \geq 0$ and $k(\theta) = 0$ otherwise. In this problem this would result in allocation $k(\theta) = \mathbb{I} \left\{ \theta \geq \frac{2}{3} \right\}$, which is not weakly decreasing as monotonicity requires.	Therefore, let us look at constant allocations $k(\theta) = \bar{k}$ instead. By linearity of buyer's payoff in $\bar{k}$ in that case, one of $\bar{k} \in \{0,1\}$ must be optimal.		Allocation rule corresponding to $\bar{k} = 0$ prescribes no trade w.p. 1, hence buyer's payoff is zero. Allocation rule $\bar{k} = 1$ prescribes trade w.p. 1 at a constant price, hence this price must be $\bar{t} = \max \theta$ for all seller types to be willing to sell. Buyer's expected payoff is then equal to	\begin{align*}		\mathbb{E} \left[ v(\theta) - 1 \right] &= \int_0^{\frac{1}{3}} \frac{3\theta}{2} d\theta + \int_{\frac{1}{3}}^{1} \left[ \frac{5 \theta}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right] d\theta -1 = \frac{35}{36} - 1 < 0,	\end{align*}	hence no trade ($k(\theta) = 0$ for all $\theta$) is optimal.			\item 		In this case we have	\begin{align*}		VS(\theta) &= 		\begin{cases}			\frac{\theta}{2} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]			\\			-\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{1}{3} &\text{ if } \theta \in [0, \frac{1}{3}]		\end{cases}	\end{align*}	Pointwise maximization yields $k(\theta) = \mathbb{I} \left\{ \theta \leq \frac{2}{3} \right\}$. Monotonicity is not violated (the allocation is weakly decreasing in $\theta$), hence this allocation is implementable.\end{enumerate}\fi\section{Cremer-McLean}	%from 2019 hw		Consider the 2x2 example from lecture. There are two players, $i=1,2$. Each of them has one of two types, $\theta_i \in \{H,L\}$. The joint distribution of types is given by $\phi(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ as follows:	\begin{center}		\begin{tabular}{c | c | c |}			& H 				& L					\\ \hline			H	& $\frac{1}{6}$ 	& $\frac{1}{3}$ 	\\ \hline			L	& $\frac{1}{3}$ 	& $\frac{1}{6}$		\\ \hline		\end{tabular}	\end{center}	Both players have quasilinear utilities.		First explore the problem of information elicitation (without the need to support any underlying allocation). 	\begin{enumerate}		\item Compute the players' interim beliefs $\phi(\theta_{-i} | \theta_i)$.		\item Compute the truth-revealing transfers $\hat{t}_i(\theta) = -\ln(\phi(\theta_{-i} | \theta_i))$.		\item Verify that a direct mechanism in which each player reports their type $\theta_i$ and pays $\hat{t}_i(\theta)$ is BIC (when coupled with some constant allocation rule $k$).	\end{enumerate}		Now suppose that the society of these two individuals chooses whether to adopt a new bank holiday called ``National Equality Day'', so the ``real outcome'' is $k \in \{1,0\}$ (where $1$ means bank holiday and $0$ means none). The holiday should only be adopted if all citizens are, in fact, equal, i.e. the desired allocation is $\tilde{k}(\theta) = \mathbb{I} \{\theta_1 = \theta_2\}$. Each citizen receives utility 1 if the holiday is adopted and 0 otherwise.	\begin{enumerate}[resume]		\item Is $\tilde{k}$ efficient?		\item Show that $\tilde{k}$ cannot be sustained without transfers, i.e. that a mechanism $(\tilde{k},t)$ with $t(\theta)=0$ for all $\theta$ is not BIC.		\item Consider transfers $t_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) = C_1 + C_2 \hat{t} (\theta_i,\theta_{-i})$.

Compute the players' interim beliefs $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})$}	Players form their beliefs using Bayes' rule:	\begin{equation}		\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})=\frac{\phi(\theta_{-i},\theta_{i})}{\sum_{\theta'_{-i}\in\Theta_{-i}}\phi(\theta'_{-i},\theta_{i})}	\end{equation}	This implies that: 	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H) &= \frac{\phi(\theta_{-i}=H,\theta_{i}=H)}{\phi(\theta_{-i}=H,\theta_{i}=H)+\phi(\theta_{-i}=L,\theta_{i}=H)} \nonumber \\ 		&= \frac{1/6}{1/6 + 1/3} \nonumber \\ 		&= 1/3\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)&=2/3\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=L)&=2/3\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=L)&=1/3	\end{align}			\subsubsection*{2. Compute the truth-revealing transfers $\hat{t}_{i}(\theta)=-ln(\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i}))$}	Inserting the values for $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})$, we find that:	\begin{align}		\hat{t}_{i}(\theta_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H)&=-ln(\phi(\theta_{-i=H}|\theta_{i=H})) \nonumber \\ 		&= -ln(1/3) = ln(3)\\		\hat{t}_{i}(\theta_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L)&=-ln(2/3)=ln(3)-ln(2)\\		\hat{t}_{i}(\theta_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=H)&=-ln(2/3)=ln(3)-ln(2)\\		\hat{t}_{i}(\theta_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=L)&=-ln(1/3)=ln(3)	\end{align}			\subsubsection*{3. Verify that a direct mechanism in which each player reports their type $\theta_{i}$ and pays $\hat{t}_{i}(\theta)$ is BIC (when		coupled with some constant allocation rule $k$)}	Given quasilinear utilites and the mechanism described, the players' utilities are given by:	\begin{equation}		u_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})=V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}) - \hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{-i})	\end{equation}	Where $V_{i}(k,\theta_{i})$ is the utility that player type $\theta_{i}$ receives from allocation $k$ and where $\hat{\theta}_{i}$ is the type, which player $i$ reports to the designer.\\\\	We also know, that for the mechanism to be Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC), it must hold that for all $i$, $\theta_{i}$ and reported $\hat{\theta}_{i}\in\Theta_i$,	\begin{equation}		E_{\theta_{-i}}[u_{i}(\theta_{i},\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})|\theta_{i}] \geq E_{\theta_{-i}}[u_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})|\theta_{i}]	\end{equation}	For player type $\theta_{i}=H$ in our example, this requires that	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H) + \nonumber \\\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L) \geq \nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=H) + \nonumber \\\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=L)\\		\rightarrow \frac{1}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3))+\frac{2}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3)+ln(2)) \geq \nonumber\\ \frac{2}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3))+\frac{1}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3)+ln(2))\\		\rightarrow \frac{2}{3}ln(2) \geq \frac{1}{3}ln(2)	\end{align}	The requirement for $\theta_{i}=H$ is therefore fulfilled. Likewise, for player type $\theta_{i}=L$, BIC requires that	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=L)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=H) + \nonumber \\\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=L)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=L) \geq \nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=L)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H) + \nonumber \\\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=L)(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L)\\		\rightarrow \frac{2}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3)+ln(2))+\frac{1}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=H)-ln(3)) \geq \nonumber\\ \frac{1}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-ln(3)+ln(2))+\frac{2}{3}(V_{i}(k,\theta_{i}=L)-ln(3))\\		\rightarrow \frac{2}{3}ln(2) \geq \frac{1}{3}ln(2)	\end{align}	Since this also holds, we have verified that a direct mechanism in which each player reports their type $\theta_{i}$ and pays $\hat{t}_{i}(\theta)$ is BIC (when	coupled with some constant allocation rule $k$).		%\\\\	%\textit{We now suppose that the society of these two individuals chooses whether to adopt a new bank holiday called "National Equality Day", so the "real outcome" is $k\in\{1,0\}$ (where 1 means bank holiday and 0 means none). The holiday should only be adopted if all citizens are, in fact, equal, i.e. the desired allocation is $\Tilde{k}(\theta)=\mathbb{I}\{\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}\}$. Each citizen receives utility 1 if the holiday is adopted and 0 otherwise.}			\subsubsection*{4. Is $\Tilde{k}$ efficient?}	From the perspective of the two agents, the allocation $\Tilde{k}$ is not efficient. If both have the same type, $\Tilde{k}$ is optimal for the players, but if they are not equal, the players would be better off if the holiday was still adopted. 	%However, from the perspective of the designer, $\Tilde{k}$ is efficient since it adopts the desired outcome.			\subsubsection*{5. Show that $\Tilde{k}$ cannot be sustained without transfers, i.e. that a mechanism $(\Tilde{k},t)$ with $t(\theta)=0$ for all $\theta$ is not BIC}	Given the mechanism described, the players' utility is given by	\begin{equation}		u_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}, \theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})=\mathbb{I}\{\hat{\theta}_{i}=\theta_{-i}\}	\end{equation}	For the mechanism to be BIC, neither player type should be incentivized to misreport their type. For player type $\theta_{i}=H$, it must therefore hold that	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)\cdot 1 + \phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)\cdot 0 \geq \nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)\cdot 0 + \phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)\cdot 1\\		\rightarrow \frac{1}{3} \geq \frac{2}{3}	\end{align}	This requirement is not fulfilled, which implies that the mechanism is not BIC. Since the player type $\theta_{i}=H$ expects that the other player is twice as likely to be type $\theta_{i}=L$, they are incentivized to misreport their type, as it would increase the chance that the holiday is adopted. Player type $\theta_{i}=L$ is likewise incentivized to report that they are player type $\theta_{i}=H$.			\subsubsection*{6. Consider transfers $t_{i}(\theta_{i},\theta_{-i})=C_{1}+C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\theta_{i},\theta_{-i})$. Derive conditions on values of $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$ for which a direct mechanism $(\Tilde{k},t)$ is BIC}	Given this transfer-scheme, the players' utilities are	\begin{align}		u_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}, \theta_{-i}|\theta_{i})=\mathbb{I}\{\hat{\theta}_{i}=\theta_{-i}\}-t_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{-i}) \nonumber\\		=\mathbb{I}\{\hat{\theta}_{i}=\theta_{-i}\}-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{-i})	\end{align}	For player type $\theta_{i}=H$, BIC therefore requires that:	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)(1-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H))+\nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)(0-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L)) \geq \nonumber\\ \phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)(0-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=H)) + \nonumber\\ \phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)(1-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=L))		\\		\rightarrow 		\frac{1}{3}(1-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3))+\frac{2}{3}(0-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3)+C_{2}ln(2)) \geq \nonumber\\ 		\frac{2}{3}(1-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3)) + \frac{1}{3}(0-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3)+C_{2}ln(2))		\\		\rightarrow		\frac{1}{3}-C_{1}-C_{2}\left(ln(3)+\frac{2}{3}ln(2)\right) \geq  \frac{2}{3}-C_{1}-C_{2}\left(ln(3)+\frac{1}{3}ln(2)\right)		\\		\frac{1}{3}C_{2}ln(2) \geq \frac{1}{3}\\		C_{2}\geq \frac{1}{ln(2)}, C_{1}\in\mathbb{R}	\end{align}	Given symmetry, the same condition is required for the mechanism to tbe BIC for player type $\theta_{i}=L$.			\subsubsection*{7. Derive conditions on values of $C_1,C_2$ for which a direct mechanism $(\Tilde{k},t)$ is interim Individually Rational (IR) and ex ante Budget Balanced (BB)}	For the mechanism to be individually rational for a player, the expected utility for the player from participating must be at least as high as their outside utility, which in this case is zero. As such, the mechanism is interim IR for player type $\theta_{i}=H$, as long as 	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)(1-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H))+\nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)(0-C_{1}-C_{2}\hat{t}_{i}(\hat{\theta}_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L)) \geq 0\\		\rightarrow		\frac{1}{3}(1-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3))+\frac{2}{3}(0-C_{1}-C_{2}ln(3)+C_{2}ln(2)) \geq 0\\		\rightarrow		C_1\leq\frac{1}{3}-C_2(ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}ln(2))	\end{align}	Once again, the same condition holds true for player type $\theta_{i}=L$.\\\\	For the mechanism to be ex ante Budget Balanced, the expected sum of payments must be non-negative, which implies that:	\begin{align}		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=H)t_i(\theta_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=H)+\nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=H)t_i(\theta_{i}=H,\theta_{-i}=L)+\nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=H|\theta_{i}=L)t_i(\theta_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=H)+\nonumber\\		\phi(\theta_{-i}=L|\theta_{i}=L)t_i(\theta_{i}=L,\theta_{-i}=L)\geq 0\\		\rightarrow		\frac{1}{6}(C_1+C_2ln(3))+\frac{1}{3}(C_1+C_2ln(3)-C_2ln(2))+\nonumber\\		\frac{1}{3}(C_1+C_2ln(3)-C_2ln(2))+\frac{1}{6}(C_1+C_2ln(3))\geq 0\\		\rightarrow		C_1+C_2ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}C_2ln(2)\geq 0\\		\rightarrow		C_1\geq -C_2(ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}ln(2))	\end{align}	For the mechanism to be interim IR and ex ante BB, $C_1$ and $C_2$ must satisfy the condition:	\begin{equation}		1/3-C_2(ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}ln(2))\geq C_1 \geq -C_2(ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}ln(2))	\end{equation}			\subsubsection*{8. Give an example of a BIC, interim IR and ex ante BB mechanism that implements $\Tilde{k}$}	We choose an arbitrary value $C_2=3$, which satisfies the BIC-condition $C_2\geq \frac{1}{ln(2)}$. We then choose $C_1$, such that the mechanism is exactly ex ante BB. This implies that 	\begin{align}		C_1=-3(ln(3)-\frac{2}{3}ln(2))\nonumber\\		=ln(\frac{4}{9})	\end{align}	The direct revelation mechanism $(\tilde{k},t)$, where transfer-scheme $t$ is given by $t_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})=ln(\frac{4}{9})-3ln(\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_{i}))$ is therefore BIC, interim IR and ex ante BB and it implements the desired allocation $\Tilde{k}$.\fi\section{Battaglini}	%from 2019 hw		Construct a perfectly revealing equilibrium in the Battaglini(2003) model with agents' biases $b_1 = (1, -3)$ and $b_2 = (-4, 2)$.

The timing of the interaction is as follows:	\begin{enumerate}		\item Nature determines the state of the world $w=(w_1,w_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, which is observed by both agents, but not the principal		\item Having observed $w$, agents $1$ and $2$ simultaneously send messages\\ ($m_1(w),m_2(w))\in\mathbb{R}^2$ to the principal about the observed state		\item Having observed messages $(m_1(w),m_2(w))$, the principal chooses the two-dimensional action $a=(m_1(w),m_2(w))\in\mathbb{R}^2$	\end{enumerate}	All players have squared-Euclidean-distance preferences, which means that they wish to minimize the distance between the principle's chosen action $a$ and their respective bliss points. The principal's bliss point is simply the true state $w$, while the agents' bliss points are the sum of their respective biases $(b_1,b_2)$ and the true state $w$. We can therefore express their utilities as:	\begin{itemize}		\item Principle: $u_p(a,w)=-(||a-w||)^2$		\item Agent $i$: $u_i(a,w)=-(||a-(w+b_i)||)^2$	\end{itemize}	where $||x||=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$, for $x=(x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$. The agents biases $b_i$ are commonly known. This implies that the principal chooses the equilibrium action such that $a^*(m_1(w),m_2(w))=E[w|(m_1(w),m_2(w))]$ and with this in mind, agent $i$ sends message $\hat{m}_i(w)$ in order to maximize their utility $u_i(a^*,w)=-(||a^*(\hat{m}_i(w),m_{-i}(w))-(w+b_i)||)^2$\\\\	The principal is able to design how the agents communicate to the principal about the observed state. In order to find a fully revealing equilibrium, the goal of the principal is to design communication strategies such that the principal is able to identify the state from the two messages and such that it is optimal for the agents to tell the truth. The Battaglini (2003) model suggests that the principal should restrict the agents' messaging, such that instead of simply reporting $w$, a given agent must report a line which is orthogonal to the other player's bias. The implication is that there is a second stage where the player then reports the true state $w$ on the line reported by the other player. However, in practice, this second stage is not necessary for the fully revealing equilibrium, since the reported lines are sufficient in order to locate $w$.\\\\	We can construct this formally by considering the basis $(c_1,c_2)$ where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are vectors which are orthogonal to the biases $b_1$ and $b_2$ respectively. As long as $b_1$ and $b_2$ are linearly independent, then so are $c_1$ and $c_2$, which implies that the true state $w$ can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of $c_1$ and $c_2$:	\begin{equation}		w=o^1 \cdot c_1 + o^2 \cdot c_2 \nonumber	\end{equation}	where $(o^1,o^2)$ are a given pair of coordinates. The principal imposes on agent $i$ that they must report the value of $o^j$. After receiving the reports, the principal then chooses $a(o^1,o^2)=o^1 \cdot c_1 + o^2 \cdot c_2$. Given that the other player reports truthfully, Battaglini shows that it is optimal for a player to also report truthfully, which in turn ensures that the true state is chosen by the principal. This implies that the mechanism provides a fully revealing equlibrium.\\\\	In our example, where $b_1=(1,-3)$ and $b_2=(-4,2)$, we use the formula $c_i=\frac{1}{||b_i||}	\begin{bmatrix}		0 & 1\\		-1 & 0	\end{bmatrix}b_i$ to calculate the vectors $(c_1,c_2)$ with unit length:	\begin{align}		c_1&=\bigg(\frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}},\frac{-1}{\sqrt{10}}\bigg) \nonumber\\		c_2&=\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\bigg) \nonumber	\end{align}	This implies that $w$ can be represented as 	\begin{align}		w&=o^1 \cdot \bigg(\frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}},\frac{-1}{\sqrt{10}}\bigg) + o^2 \cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\bigg)\nonumber\\		\rightarrow w_1&=o^1(\frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}})+o^2(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}})\ \ \text{and}\ \ \nonumber		w_2=o^1(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{10}})+o^2(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}) \nonumber	\end{align}	Solving for $o^1$ and $o^2$, we find that	\begin{equation}		o^1=-\sqrt{10}(w_1-2w_2) \ \ \text{and} \ \ o^2=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}(3w_2-w_1)\nonumber	\end{equation}	Given a realized state $w=(w_1,w_2)$, these values of $o^1$ and $o^2$ are the equilibrium reporting strategies of the two agents in our example, which imply that the principal chooses the true state $a=w$.\fi\end{document}
