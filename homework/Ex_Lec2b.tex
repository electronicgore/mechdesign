\begin{ex}[P2: Implementability conditions]
	In the Euclidean world we showed that monotonicity and the Mirrlees conditions were necessary for an indirect utility function to arise from a DSIC mechanism. Show sufficiency:  for any indirect utility function $U$ that satisfies monotonicity and the Mirrlees condition there is a DSIC social choice function which yields $U$.
	
	\ifsolutions
	\subsection*{Solution 1 (Hannah \& Inga)}
	
	DSIC means that you report your true type $\theta$, DSIC condition: 
	$$U_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) \geq \ U_i(\hat\theta_i,\theta_i)$$
	
	Then it is better to report your true type than to report a fake type.
	
	Monotonicity:
	
	$$k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})\geq \ k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i})  \quad \text{if} \quad \theta_i \geq\ \hat\theta_i $$
	
	which implies that the agent who values the good more, will also get more of the allocations.
	
	Indirect utility functions are of the type:
	
	$$U_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})=u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i)$$
	
	%where $x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})$ refers to the best possible combination of allocations and transfers. 
	
	In order to show sufficiency, we can start with the monotonicity condition
	
	$$k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})\geq \ k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) $$
	
	The indirect utility function follows the Euclidean form:
	$u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i)=\theta_i*k(\theta_i)-t_i(\theta_i),$
	which can be rearranged to
	$k(\theta_i)=\frac{u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i)+t_i(\theta_i)}{\theta_i}.$
	Plugging it in yields:
	
	$$\frac{u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i) + t_i(\theta_i)}{\theta_i}\geq \ k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) $$
	$$u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i) + t_i(\theta_i) \geq \ \theta_{i} k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) $$
	$$u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i) \geq \ \theta_{i}k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) $$
	$$u_i(x(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\theta_i) \geq \ u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_-i),\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) $$
	
	$$U_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) \geq \ u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_-i),\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) $$
	
	where $u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_-i),\theta_i)$ is the case where you report a false type.
	
	We can do the same for other types $\hat\theta_i$:
	
	$$k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})\geq \ k_i(\hat\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) $$
	
	The indirect utility function for $\hat\theta_i$ is:	
	$u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\hat\theta_i)=\hat\theta_{i}k(\hat\theta_i)-t_i(\hat\theta_i),$
	which can be rearranged to:
	$k(\hat\theta_i)=\frac{u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\hat\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta_i)}{\hat\theta_i}.$
	Plugging it in results in:
	
	$$k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})\geq \ \frac{u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}))+t_i(\hat\theta_i)}{\hat\theta_i} $$
	
	$$\hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})\geq \ u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\hat\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta_i) $$
	
	$$\hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i)\geq \ u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}),\hat\theta_i) $$
	$$\hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i)\geq \ U_i(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) $$\\
	
	What we basically have to show:
	
	$$U_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) \geq \ u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_-i),\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) \geq\ \hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i)\geq \ U_i(\hat\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) $$
	
	so basically just
	
	$$u_i(x(\hat\theta_i,\theta_-i),\theta_i)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) \geq\ \hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i) $$
	
	which collapses to
	
	$$\theta k(\hat\theta,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta)+t_i(\hat\theta) -t_i(\theta_i) \geq\ \hat\theta_{i}k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i) $$
	
	$$\theta k(\hat\theta,\theta_{-i}) -t_i(\theta_i) \geq\ \hat\theta_i*k(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})-t_i(\hat\theta_i) $$
	
	
	...

\begin{ex}[P3: Budget balance]
	Prove that if a mechanism is ex post budget balanced then it is also ex ante budget balanced.
	
	\ifsolutions
	\subsection*{Solution}
	Ex post budget balance means that the sum of all transfers is zero with probability one. Ex ante budget balance means that the expected sum of all transfers is zero.
	
	Ex post budget balance requires budget balance for all $\theta$:
	\begin{align} \label{eq:BB_post}
		\sum_i t_i(\theta) \geq 0
	\end{align}
	
	Ex ante budget balance requires budget balance on average:
	\begin{align} \nonumber
		\mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \sum_i t_i(\theta) \right] \geq 0
		\\  \label{eq:BB_ante}
		\Leftrightarrow \int_{\theta \in \Theta} \left[ \sum_i t_i(\theta) \right] dF(\theta) \geq 0
	\end{align}
	
	Ex post BB condition \eqref{eq:BB_post} implies that the expression in brackets in \eqref{eq:BB_ante} is nonnegative with probability 1, therefore the integral of these values w.r.t. $\theta$ is nonnegative as well.
	%Ex post budget balance is therefore more restrictive than ex ante budget balance.
	
	Ex post budget balance implies ex ante budget balance, but not vice versa.

\begin{ex}[P4: Bilateral trade]
	Is there an efficient, DSIC, ex post IR, ex post BB mechanism in the bilateral trade setting (slides 68/83)? (Hint: Start from VCG and invoke revenue equivalence.)
	
	\ifsolutions
	\subsection*{Solution}
	A mechanism is 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ex post individual rational, if $u_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i}) \geq\ 0$
		
		\item ex post budget balanced, if $\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i(\theta) \geq\ 0 $
		
		\item ex post efficient, if there is only trade if $\theta_s<\theta_b$
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	Start from VCG mechanism and invoke revenue equivalence.
	
	Revenue equivalence = any mechanism that results in the same outcomes (allocations and transfers) also has the same revenue. \emph{Note: while the statement is factually correct, it does not allow to answer the problem, since transfers are not fixed.}
	
	A VCG mechanism is not individual rational for the seller (outside option is to keep the good).\\
	
	The outcomes in the VCG mechanism are:
	
	$$t_b^{VCG}\theta=\theta_s*\mathbb{I} [\theta_s<\theta_b]$$
	$$t_s^{VCG}\theta=\theta_b*\mathbb{I} [\theta_s\geq\ \theta_b]$$
	
	The seller pays to keep the good (if his valuation is higher) and doesn't get anything when selling it. Therefore, this mechanism is not individual rational for the seller.
	
	At the moment, no one wants to participate in the mechanism. The transfers have to be increased in order to make it attractive for the participants. The transfers cannot be increased though because then the budget balance will break down. Therefore we can conclude, that there does not exist a DSIC mechanism which is efficient, ex post IR and ex post BB in the bilateral trade setting.

\begin{ex}[P5: Implementation in Auctions]
	Consider the auction environment with two buyers.  Suppose that each buyer $i$ has willingness to pay
	$v_i$ drawn from the set $[0,1].$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Draw a square with $v_1$ on the horizontal axis and $v_2$ on the vertical axis.  A point in the square
		represents a profile $(v_1, v_2)$.
		\item Draw a downward sloping curve through the box.
		\item Draw an upward sloping curve through the box that intersects the downward sloping curve (exactly once.)
		\item The region above your downward sloping curve is divided into two subregions by your upward sloping curve.  Label
		the subregion that is above your upward sloping curve with a $2$ and label the other subregion with a $1$.  Label
		the entire region that is below (and to the left of) your downward sloping curve with a $0$.
		\item Consider the allocation rule that is defined by your drawing.  In the $1$ region agent $1$ gets the
		good, in the $2$ region agent $2$ gets the good and in the $0$ region neither agent gets the good.  (On the boundary
		between regions pick the allocation from one of the neighboring regions. )  Find a transfer rule which, when
		coupled with your allocation rule, forms a DSIC mechanism.
		\item Is there any DSIC allocation rule that picks alternatives from the set $\{0,1,2\}$ that could not be represented
		by a drawing that follows the instructions given above?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\ifsolutions
	\subsection*{Solution}
	Before solving the exercise we will show the following claim. Consider the environment as the one in the instructions, where the utility of type $v_i$ when he announces $v_i^{'}$ and his rival announces $v_{-i}$ is:
	\begin{align*}
	U_{i}(v_i^{'}|v_{i})=v_iq_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})-t_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})\\
	U_i(v_{i})=U_i(v_i|v_i)
	\end{align*}
	where $q_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})\in[0,1]$ is the probability that $i$ gets the good when the announcements are $(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ and $t_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})$ are the payments that need to be done by $i$ in that case.
	\begin{lemma}
		A mechanism $(q(\cdot),t(\cdot))$ is DSIC if and only if for all $i$ and $v_{-i}$ the allocation $q_{i}(\cdot,v_{-i})$ is weakly increasing and
		\begin{align}\label{int}
		U_{i}(v_i)=U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
		\end{align}
		%Moreover, if $q(\cdot)$ is such that for all $i,v_{-i}$ $q_{i}(\cdot,v_{-i})$ is weakly increasing and satisfies (\ref{int}), then it is DSIC.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		\begin{description}
			\item [($\Rightarrow$)] \emph{Note: we have done this part during lectures.}
			
			Suppose $(q(\cdot),t(\cdot))$ is DSIC. Then, for all $i,v_i$ it holds that:
			\begin{align*}
			U_i(v_i)\geq U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)\\
			U_i(v_{i}^{'})\geq U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})
			\end{align*}
			Note that: $U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)=U_i(v_{i}^{'}|v_{i}^{'})+(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ and $U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})=U_i(v_{i}|v_{i})+(v_i^{'}-v_i)q_i(v_i,v_{-i})$. Then we may rewrite the above inequalities as:
			\begin{align*}
			U_i(v_i)\geq U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)=U_i(v_{i}^{'}|v_{i}^{'})+(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\\
			U_i(v_{i}^{'})\geq U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})=U_i(v_{i}|v_{i})+(v_i^{'}-v_i)q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			Rearranging, we obtain that:
			\begin{align*}
			(v_i-v_{i}^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\leq U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})\leq (v_i-v_{i}^{'})q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			Assume, wlog, that $v_i>v_i^{'}$. Then, the above inequality implies that $q_i(v_i,v_{-i})\geq q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ as desired. Moreover, rearranging the inequality we get that:
			\begin{align*}
			q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\leq \frac{U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})}{(v_i-v_{i}^{'})}\leq q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			and taking limits as $v_{i}^{'}\rightarrow v_i$ we get that:
			\begin{align*}
			U_i^{'}(v_i)= q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			And hence, we may write $U_i(v_i)$ as:
			\begin{align*}
			U_{i}(v_i)=U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
			\end{align*}
			for $\underbar{v}_i<v_i$.
			
			\item [($\Leftarrow$)] Assume you have an allocation $q(\cdot)$ that is weakly increasing and satisfies (\ref{int}). Then, construct transfers as:
			\begin{align*}
			t_i(v_i,v_{-i})=v_iq_i(v_i,v_{-i})-U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})-\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
			\end{align*}
			We will show that $(q,t)$ is DSIC. Fix $v_{-i}$ and let $v_i>v_{i}^{'}$. Then:
			\begin{align*}
			U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})= \int_{v^{'}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du\geq \int_{v^{'}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})du=(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			where we used the monotonicity of $q_i$ to get the inequality. Hence,
			\begin{align*}
			U_i(v_i)\geq v_iq_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-(v_i^{'}q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-U_i(v_i^{'}))=v_iq_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-t_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})
			\end{align*}
			where we used the constructed transfers to get the last equality. Hence, the mechanism is DSIC.
		\end{description}
	\end{proof}
	From now on, we will work 	with the following figure:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{figure}[htbp]
			\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./ps2}
		\end{figure}
	\end{center}
	\newpage
	\paragraph\indent Of course, there will be some things that are specific to the drawing, but the way we will solve the exercise (mainly, by using the result above) should illustrate the general procedure for different figures. Based on the figure, we construct the following allocation:
	\[q_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{ if } v_2+a_2v_1\leq b_2\quad \text{ or }\quad v_2\geq b_1+a_1v_1\\
	1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\[q_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{ if } v_2+a_2v_1\leq b_2\quad \text{ or }\quad v_2\leq b_1+a_1v_1\\
	1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\newline\indent From the lemma above we know that we have no hope of implementing the allocation if it is not monotone. However, it is very easy to check (just observe the drawing) that fixing the type of the other player, the probability of getting the good weakly increases with the player's type. Now we have to construct the transfers to implement this in dominant strategies. We will make use once again of the lemma, mainly of the result that:
	\begin{align} \label{transfer}
	t_i(v_i,v_{-i})=v_iq_i(v_i,v_{-i})-U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
	\end{align}
	are the transfers that work.
	\newline\indent Let's start with $t_1(v_1,v_2)$. Note that if $v_2>\tilde{v}_2$, no matter what type player 1 announces $q_1(\cdot,v_2)=0$. Hence, $t_1(v_1,v_2)=0$ for $v_2>\tilde{v}_2$. Consider now $v_2\in[\hat{v}_2,\tilde{v}_2]$. In that case, $q_1(v_1,v_2)=1$ if and only if $v_1\geq\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}$. Then,  for $v_2\in[\hat{v}_2,\tilde{v}_2]$:
	
	\[t_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_1\leq\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}\\
	\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1} & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	where the last part comes from using (\ref{transfer}) and noticing that $\underbar{v}_1=\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}$ and setting $U_1(\underbar{v}_1)=0$:
	\begin{align*}
	t_1(v_1,v_2)=v_1-\int_{\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}}^{v_1}1 du=\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}
	\end{align*}
	Finally, consider $v_2\leq\hat{v}_2$. In that case, $q_1(\cdot,v_2)=0$ for $v_1\leq \frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2}=\underbar{v}_1$. Then, in that case:
	
	\[t_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_1\leq\frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2}\\
	\frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2} & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\newline\indent Notice that, apart from the result of the lemma saying it is the case, it is clear why the mechanism is DSIC: whether the player pays or not depends on his announcement, but not how much he pays. In this much, it is like a SPA.
	\newline\indent We can calculate the transfers for player 2 in a similar manner. Consider $v_1<\hat{v}_1$. Then, $q_2(v_1,v_2)=0$ if $v_2\leq b_2-a_2 v_1$. Then,
	
	\[t_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_2\leq b_2-a_2 v_1\\
	b_2-a_2 v_1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	On the other hand, if $v_1\geq\hat{v}_1$, we have that $q_2(v_1,v_2)=0$ if $v_2\leq a_1v_1+b_1$. Then:
	\[t_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_2\leq b_1+a_1 v_1\\
	b_1+a_1 v_1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
