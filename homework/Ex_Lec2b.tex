\begin{ex}[Review Questions]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Groves-Clarke mechanism implements the efficient allocation in dominant stratgies. Why does this not violate the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem?
		\item Why is it a dominant strategy in the VCG mechanism to reveal oneâ€™s true type? What is the idea behind the mechanism? Why are VCG transfers sometimes called "externality transfers"?
		\item What is the fundamental tension between the requirements of Individual Rationality and Budget Balance?
		\item In which sense is monotonicity requirement (for an s.c.f. to be DSIC in a Euclidean model) related to WPRP condition from the general model?
		\item What is the main driving force behind revenue equivalence? Does it imply that the expected revenue and players' expected payoffs are fixed given a social choice function?
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{ex}



%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{ex}[Implementability conditions]
	In the Euclidean world we showed that monotonicity and the Mirrlees conditions were necessary for an indirect utility function to arise from a DSIC mechanism. Show sufficiency:  for any indirect utility function $U$ that satisfies monotonicity and the Mirrlees condition there is a DSIC social choice function which yields $U$.

\begin{ex}[Implementation in Auctions]
	Consider the auction environment with two buyers.  Suppose that each buyer $i$ has willingness to pay
	$v_i$ drawn from the set $[0,1].$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Draw a square with $v_1$ on the horizontal axis and $v_2$ on the vertical axis.  A point in the square
		represents a profile $(v_1, v_2)$.
		\item Draw a downward sloping curve through the box.
		\item Draw an upward sloping curve through the box that intersects the downward sloping curve (exactly once.)
		\item The region above your downward sloping curve is divided into two subregions by your upward sloping curve.  Label
		the subregion that is above your upward sloping curve with a $2$ and label the other subregion with a $1$.  Label
		the entire region that is below (and to the left of) your downward sloping curve with a $0$.
		\item Consider the allocation rule that is defined by your drawing.  In the $1$ region agent $1$ gets the
		good, in the $2$ region agent $2$ gets the good and in the $0$ region neither agent gets the good.  (On the boundary
		between regions pick the allocation from one of the neighboring regions. )  Find a transfer rule which, when
		coupled with your allocation rule, forms a DSIC mechanism.
		\item Is there any DSIC allocation rule that picks alternatives from the set $\{0,1,2\}$ that could not be represented
		by a drawing that follows the instructions given above?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\ifsolutions
	\section*{Solution}
	Before solving the exercise we will show the following claim. Consider the environment as the one in the instructions, where the utility of type $v_i$ when he announces $v_i^{'}$ and his rival announces $v_{-i}$ is:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	U_{i}(v_i^{'}|v_{i})=v_iq_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})-t_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})\\
	U_i(v_{i})=U_i(v_i|v_i)
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $q_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})\in[0,1]$ is the probability that $i$ gets the good when the announcements are $(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ and $t_i(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})$ are the payments that need to be done by $i$ in that case.
	\begin{lem}
		A mechanism $(q(\cdot),t(\cdot))$ is DSIC if for all $i,v_{-i}$ $q_{i}(\cdot,v_{-i})$ is weakly increasing. Moreover,
		\begin{eqnarray}\label{int}
		U_{i}(v_i)=U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
		\end{eqnarray}
		Moreover, if $q(\cdot)$ is such that for all $i,v_{-i}$ $q_{i}(\cdot,v_{-i})$ is weakly increasing and satisfies (\ref{int}), then it is DSIC.
	\end{lem}
	\begin{proof}
		\begin{description}
			\item [($\Rightarrow$)] Suppose $(q(\cdot),t(\cdot))$ is DSIC. Then, for all $i,v_i$ it holds that:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_i(v_i)\geq U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)\\
			U_i(v_{i}^{'})\geq U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})
			\end{eqnarray}
			Note that: $U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)=U_i(v_{i}^{'}|v_{i}^{'})+(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ and $U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})=U_i(v_{i}|v_{i})+(v_i^{'}-v_i)q_i(v_i,v_{-i})$. Then we may rewrite the above inequalities as:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_i(v_i)\geq U_i(v_i^{'}|v_i)=U_i(v_{i}^{'}|v_{i}^{'})+(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\\
			U_i(v_{i}^{'})\geq U_i(v_i|v_i^{'})=U_i(v_{i}|v_{i})+(v_i^{'}-v_i)q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			Rearranging, we obtain that:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			(v_i-v_{i}^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\leq U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})\leq (v_i-v_{i}^{'})q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			Assume, wlog, that $v_i>v_i^{'}$. Then, the above inequality implies that $q_i(v_i,v_{-i})\geq q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})$ as desired. Moreover, rearranging the inequality we get that:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})\leq \frac{U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})}{(v_i-v_{i}^{'})}\leq q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			and taking limits as $v_{i}^{'}\rightarrow v_i$ we get that:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_i^{'}(v_i)= q_i(v_i,v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			And hence, we may write $U_i(v_i)$ as:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_{i}(v_i)=U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
			\end{eqnarray}
			for $\underbar{v}_i<v_i$.
			\item [($\Leftarrow$)] Assume you have an allocation $q(\cdot)$ that is weakly increasing and satisfies (\ref{int}). Then, construct transfers as:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			t_i(v_i,v_{-i})=v_iq_i(v_i,v_{-i})-U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})-\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
			\end{eqnarray}
			We will show that $(q,t)$ is DSIC. Fix $v_{-i}$ and let $v_i>v_{i}^{'}$. Then:
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_i(v_i)-U_{i}(v_i^{'})= \int_{v^{'}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du\geq \int_{v^{'}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(v_{i}^{'},v_{-i})du=(v_i-v_i^{'})q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			where we used the monotonicity of $q_i$ to get the inequality. Hence,
			\begin{eqnarray}
			U_i(v_i)\geq v_iq_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-(v_i^{'}q_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-U_i(v_i^{'}))=v_iq_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})-t_i(v_i^{'},v_{-i})
			\end{eqnarray}
			where we used the constructed transfers to get the last equality. Hence, the mechanism is DSIC.
		\end{description}
	\end{proof}
	From now on, we will work 	with the following figure:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{figure}[htbp]
			\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./ps2}
		\end{figure}
	\end{center}
	\newpage
	\paragraph\indent Of course, there will be some things that are specific to the drawing, but the way we will solve the exercise (mainly, by using the result above) should illustrate the general procedure for different figures. Based on the figure, we construct the following allocation:
	\[q_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{ if } v_2+a_2v_1\leq b_2\quad \text{ or }\quad v_2\geq b_1+a_1v_1\\
	1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\[q_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{ if } v_2+a_2v_1\leq b_2\quad \text{ or }\quad v_2\leq b_1+a_1v_1\\
	1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\newline\indent From the lemma above we know that we have no hope of implementing the allocation if it is not monotone. However, it is very easy to check (just observe the drawing) that fixing the type of the other player, the probability of getting the good weakly increases with the player's type. Now we have to construct the transfers to implement this in dominant strategies. We will make use once again of the lemma, mainly of the result that:
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{transfer}
	t_i(v_i,v_{-i})=v_iq_i(v_i,v_{-i})-U_i(\underbar{v}_{i})+\int_{\underbar{v}_{i}}^{v_i}q_{i}(u,v_{-i})du
	\end{eqnarray}
	are the transfers that work.
	\newline\indent Let's start with $t_1(v_1,v_2)$. Note that if $v_2>\tilde{v}_2$, no matter what type player 1 announces $q_1(\cdot,v_2)=0$. Hence, $t_1(v_1,v_2)=0$ for $v_2>\tilde{v}_2$. Consider now $v_2\in[\hat{v}_2,\tilde{v}_2]$. In that case, $q_1(v_1,v_2)=1$ if and only if $v_1\geq\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}$. Then,  for $v_2\in[\hat{v}_2,\tilde{v}_2]$:
	
	\[t_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_1\leq\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}\\
	\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1} & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	where the last part comes from using (\ref{transfer}) and noticing that $\underbar{v}_1=\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}$ and setting $U_1(\underbar{v}_1)=0$:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	t_1(v_1,v_2)=v_1-\int_{\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}}^{v_1}1 du=\frac{v_2-b_1}{a_1}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Finally, consider $v_2\leq\hat{v}_2$. In that case, $q_1(\cdot,v_2)=0$ for $v_1\leq \frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2}=\underbar{v}_1$. Then, in that case:
	
	\[t_1(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_1\leq\frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2}\\
	\frac{b_2-v_2}{a_2} & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	\newline\indent Notice that, apart from the result of the lemma saying it is the case, it is clear why the mechanism is DSIC: whether the player pays or not depends on his announcement, but not how much he pays. In this much, it is like a SPA.
	\newline\indent We can calculate the transfers for player 2 in a similar manner. Consider $v_1<\hat{v}_1$. Then, $q_2(v_1,v_2)=0$ if $v_2\leq b_2-a_2 v_1$. Then,
	
	\[t_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_2\leq b_2-a_2 v_1\\
	b_2-a_2 v_1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]
	On the other hand, if $v_1\geq\hat{v}_1$, we have that $q_2(v_1,v_2)=0$ if $v_2\leq a_1v_1+b_1$. Then:
	\[t_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \quad\text{ if }\quad  v_2\leq b_1+a_1 v_1\\
	b_1+a_1 v_1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
	
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\]

%TODO: this is for correlated types
%\begin{ex}[Asymmetric Auctions]
%	Consider the optimal auction problem in which there are two bidders whose valuations $v_i \in [0,1]$ are uniformly distributed but perfectly correlated, i.e. $v_1 = v_2$ with probability 1.  Construct a DSIC mechanism with the following properties:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Bidder 2 wins the object regardless of the type profile.
%		\item Both bidders earn zero utility at every type profile.
%	\end{enumerate}
%	
%	\ifsolutions
%	\section*{Solution}
%	Consider the following allocation:
%	\[q_1(v_1,v_2)=0\]
%	\[q_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{ if }\quad v_2\neq v_1\\
%	1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad
%	
%	\end{array}
%	\right.\]
%	\[t_1(v_1,v_2)=0\]
%	\[t_2(v_1,v_2)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \text{if}\quad v_2\neq v_1\\
%	v_1 & \quad\text{otherwise}\quad\end{array}\right.\]
%	Note that for bidder 1 it is weakly dominant to say his valuation: he never gets the good so he might as well say $v_1$. For player 2, we have exactly the same situation: given the message sent by agent 1, he is indifferent between saying the truth and not, so telling the truth is weakly dominant. Agent 2 gets the good always and both bidders have 0 utility at every profile.
