These exercises are for your own practice and are not to be handed in. Some exercises are open ended in that they may not have a unique correct answer. If you think there is a typo in the problem, attempt to amend it and proceed as best you can.

\begin{ex}[Review Questions]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What are the possible dynamic linkages that might prevent us from splitting a dynamic mechanism design problem into a collection of independent static problems?
		\item How does the solution to the static problem of efficient implementation extend to the dynamic problem? What are the main challenges?
		\item 
	\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}
	Consider a problem of climate change, modelled as follows. There are two generations (players) $i=1,2$ and two periods $t=1,2$; each player $i$ only exists in their respective period $t=i$.\footnote{The distinction between indices $i$ and $t$ is somewhat arbitrary in this problem. The problem tries to stick to the more appropriate of the two indices in all cases, but they are often interchangeable. The double index $i,t$ is collapsed to a single one wherever required.} 
	Each player has some type $\theta_i \sim \text{i.i.d.} U[0,1]$, and their utilities are given by:
	\begin{align*}
		u_1 (\theta_1,k_1) &= \theta_1 k_1 - k_1^2 - p_1
		\\
		u_2 (\theta_2,k_1,k_2) &= \theta_2 k_2 - (k_1+k_2)^2 - p_2,
	\end{align*}
	in periods when they exist, and zero in other periods.
	Here allocation $k_t \in \mathbb{R_+}$ represents the level of fossil fuels usage at time $t$, $\theta_i$ is the value that generation $i$ extracts from burning fossils at time $t=i$, and the quadratic term represents the global losses stemming from this usage. Note that this includes past usage: player $2$ suffers from usage $k_1$.
	
	Your goal is to derive the efficient mechanism. You can think of the designer as some international organization (e.g., the UN), and of transfers as some kind of globally agreed upon carbon tax. We will use the dynamic pivot mechanism.\footnote{This problem does not strictly fit into the general model we set up in class due to the explicit dependence of $u_2$ on $k_1$, but all same methods are still applicable. Further, you can omit dependence of all objects on $K_t$, since the set $K_t$ of feasible allocations does not change over time in this problem.}
	Follow closely the expressions on slide 172. Assume that there is no discounting ($\delta = 1$).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Write down the flow social surplus function for $t=2$. Write down the welfare function for $t=2$. Find the efficient allocation $k^*_2$ for the time-$2$ generation.
		\item Find the transfers $p^{DPM}_2$ for the time-$2$ generation as prescribed by the dynamic pivot mechanism. \emph{(Hint: player $2$ is the only player in existence from $t=2$ onwards. What externalities does he impose on other existing players? What externalities is he subject to? What does this imply for $p^{DPM}_2$?)}
		\item Write down the flow social surplus function for $t=1$. Write down the welfare function for $t=1$. (Keep in mind that it should account for the effect of $k_1$ on future generation.) Find the efficient allocation $k^*_1$ for the time-$1$ generation.
		\item Write down the marginal contributions of player $1$ in both periods. Find flow marginal contributions of player $1$. Find the optimal payments for player $1$.
		\item Verify that mechanism is ``online'', i.e., each player is only required to make payments in those periods in which they are alive.
