These exercises are for your own practice and are not to be handed in. Some exercises are open ended in that they may not have a unique correct answer. If you think there is a typo in the problem, attempt to amend it and proceed as best you can.

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{ex}[Review Questions]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is a stable matching? Why is stability a desirable concept?
		\item Is the Deferred Acceptance algorithm incentive compatible for the players (i.e., is it optimal to play truthfully)? Do there exist incentive compatible mechanisms? How does your answer depend on the information available to the players?
		\item What mechanisms can we use for the item allocation problem? Why do they not work for the more general marriage problem?
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{ex}



%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{ex}
	This problem is meant to demonstrate the power of DA algorithm, which finds a stable matching in \emph{any} marriage market. 
	
	Consider a market with four men and four women. Come up with arbitrary preferences for all players (i.e., a ranking for each player of all players on the other side of the market and the option to stay single).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find a stable matching generated by men-proposing DA algorithm.
		\item Find a stable matching generated by women-proposing DA algorithm.
		\item Are there any other stable matchings?
		\item Suppose a men-proposing DA algorithm is run. Is there a profitable deviation for any of the women -- i.e., can any woman misreport her preferences to the mechanism to improve her matching? 
		
		(\emph{Hint: such a deviation exists if and only if you have more than one stable matching, which happens if and only if the outcomes of W-DA and M-DA algorithms are different.})

\begin{ex}
	This problem demonstrates how marriage model can be extended to allow many-to-one matchings, which turns it into a ``college admissions model''.
	
	There is a market with four students $S = \{s_1, ..., s_4\}$ and three colleges $C= \{c_1, c_2, c_3\}$. College $c_1$ can admit two students (its \emph{quota} is $q_1=2$); the remaining two colleges can admit one student each ($q_2=q_3=1$). Players' preferences (ordinal rankings, written best to worst) are given by
	\begin{align*}
		\succ_{s_1}: &\ c_3, c_1, c_2	&	\succ_{c_1}: &\ s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4
		\\
		\succ_{s_2}: &\ c_2, c_1, c_3	&	\succ_{c_2}: &\ s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4
		\\
		\succ_{s_3}: &\ c_1, c_3, c_2	&	\succ_{c_3}: &\ s_3, s_1, s_2, s_4
		\\
		\succ_{s_4}: &\ c_1, c_2, c_3
	\end{align*}
	
	Your goal is to find a stable matching in this problem. The only difference from the marriage model we considered in class is that college $c_1$ can admit \emph{two} students. The trick is to represent the two available spots in $c_1$ as two independent players which have the same preferences over students and which rank equally against other colleges among the students.
	
	In particular, consider instead a market with the same four students but now four colleges $C' = \{c_{1.1}, c_{1.2}, c_2, c_3\}$ (each with quota $q_i=1$, as in the marriage model), and preferences are given by 
	\begin{align*}
	\succ_{s_1}: &\ c_3, c_{1.1}, c_{1.2}, c_2	&	\succ_{c_{1.1}}: &\ s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4
	\\
	\succ_{s_2}: &\ c_2, c_{1.1}, c_{1.2}1, c_3	&	\succ_{c_{1.2}}: &\ s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4
	\\
	\succ_{s_3}: &\ c_{1.1}, c_{1.2}, c_3, c_2	&	\succ_{c_2}: &\ s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4
	\\
	\succ_{s_4}: &\ c_{1.1}, c_{1.2}, c_2, c_3	&	\succ_{c_3}: &\ s_3, s_1, s_2, s_4
	\end{align*}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use the college-proposing DA algorithm to find a stable matching.
		\item Matching $\mu$ generated by the C-DA algorithm is \emph{weakly} Pareto-optimal for the set $C'$ of players. However, there is another stable matching $\mu' = \{ (c_1, s_2, s_4), (c_2, s_1), (c_3, s_3) \}$ which is strictly preferred to $\mu$ by all colleges in $C$. How can you explain this contradiction?
