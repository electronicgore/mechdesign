Suppose that parents (the designer) are debating with their teenage kid (the player/agent) regarding the kid's possible career paths. In particular, in every period $t \in \{0,1,\dots,\infty\}$ the kid can take up one of three jobs, $a \in \{l,m,r\}$, which are as follows:	\begin{itemize}		\item $a=l$ means beginning/continuing on track to becoming a lawyer, whether it is studying or taking up appropriate jobs. This yields payoff $B$ to the parents and $b$ to the kid.				\item $a=m$ means working at a local McDonald'sâ„¢, which yields payoff $0$ to both parents and the kid. 				\item $a=r$ means playing rock music. This yields payoff $B$ to the kid, who really enjoys playing rock music, but only yields payoff $b$ to the parents, who would prefer the kid to become a lawyer.	\end{itemize}	The assumption in the above is that $B>b>0$.	Further, being a good lawyer requires inspiration, which may or may not be present in any given period. Let the state $\theta_t \in \{0,1\}$ denote whether the kid has lawyer's inspiration in period $t$. If $\theta_t=0$ then $a=l$ is not a feasible choice -- i.e., it can not be chosen in period $t$.\footnote{You can think that choosing $a_t=0$ when $\theta_t=0$ yields utility $-\infty$ to both the kid and the parents. This is a bit too dramatic, but is good enough for the example.} The common belief of the parents and the kid is that $\theta_t$ is i.i.d. across periods, and $\mathbb{P}\{\theta_t=1\} = \phi$. Once period $t$ arrives, the kid privately observes $\theta_t$ before making a decision, but the parents do not observe $\theta_t$ at $t$ or any other period.		The parents can put a hard veto on whether their kid becomes a rock musician in any given period, $s \in \{0,1\}$. I.e., they can exclude $a=r$ from the choice set in any given period. If this happens ($s_t=1$), the kid then faces a choice between $a_t \in \{l,m\}$ if $\theta_t=1$ and $a_t = m$ (no choice) if $\theta_t=0$, while if the parents give the kid the freedom to choose ($s_t=0$), then the choice is between $a_t \in \{l,m,r\}$ if $\theta_t=1$ and $a_t \in \{m,r\}$ if $\theta_t=0$.		Assume that both the parents and the kid discount the future using discount factor $\delta \in (0,1)$.\footnote{One util tomorrow is worth $\delta$ utils today.} Your goal is to design an optimal veto strategy for the parents. 		\begin{enumerate}		\item Consider the parents' strategy of never imposing the veto power ($s_t=0$ for all $t$). What is the kid's optimal strategy then? (Note that a strategy must specify an action for every history -- i.e., for every period $t$, every realization of $\theta_t$, given every possible history of past states and actions.) Calculate the parents' expected discounted lifetime payoff $V_0^{free}$ from the kid following this optimal strategy. Calculate the kid's expected discounted lifetime payoff $V_1^{free}$.				\emph{Note: we think of these payoffs as being estimated before the first state $\theta_0$ is revealed to the kid.}				\item Consider the parents' strategy of always restricting the kid ($s_t=1$ for all $t$). Answer the same questions as in part 1: what is the kid's optimal strategy? What is the parents' payoff $V_0^{veto}$? What is the kid's payoff $V_1^{veto}$?	\end{enumerate}		Consider now the following strategy for the parents. In the first period, $t=0$, they give the kid the freedom of choice ($s_0=0$). If $a_0=l$, the parents never control the kid again $s_t=0$ for all $t \geq 1$). If $a_0=r$, the parents will always control the kid ($s_t=1$ for all $t \geq 1$). The intent is that this will incentivize the kid to choose $a_0=l$ if $\theta_0=1$. Assume also that parents can commit to such ``conditional veto'' strategy at $t=0$.		\begin{enumerate}[resume]		\item Derive the IC condition for the kid (for it to be optimal for them to choose $a_0=l$ if $\theta_0=1$).				\item Calculate the parents' expected utility from adopting this ``conditional veto'' strategy (assuming the kid's IC condition holds).				\item Assume the following parameter values: $\phi=1/2$, $\delta=1/3$, $B=3$, $b=2$. Verify that the kid's IC condition holds.				\item Given the parameter values from part 4: is this strategy better for the parents than laissez-faire (no veto ever) and/or permanent restriction, from parts 1 and 2 of this problem respectively?				\item Given the parameter values from part 4: argue to the best of your ability what the parents' optimal strategy is. (If they can do better than conditional veto, explain how. If they can not, explain why.)	\end{enumerate}						\ifsolutions\section*{Solution}	\fi\end{document}
