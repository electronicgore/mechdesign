\begin{ex}
	A seller possesses a single indivisible object for which there are two potential buyers.    Each buyer $i \in \{1,2\}$ has value$v_i$ for the good and the seller has an opportunity cost $c$ from selling the good.  Utility is quasi-linear in money  so if buyer $i$ purchases the good at price $p$ his final utility is$v_i-p$, and the seller's utility is $p-c$.
	Each agent has zero utility if he does not trade and zero is therefore also the reservation utility of each agent.
	Each $v_i$ is drawn independently from the same distribution $F$ which has support $[0,\bar v]$, and $c$ is drawn independently from a distribution $G$ which has support $[0,\bar c]$.  Assume that $F$ and $G$ satisfy all of the conditions necessary for the revenueequivalence theorem and our characterization results in class.
	
	\medskip
	A mechanism consists of two functions $q(c, v_1, v_2)$ and $t(c, v_1, v_2)$ where, as a function of the agents' types, $q(c, v_1, v_2)$ is the allocation rule that gives the probabilities that the good will be allocated to each of the three agents and $t(c, v_1, v_2)$ gives the list of transfers paid to each of the three agents.Say that a mechanism \emph{feasible} if it is Bayesian incentive compatible, interim individually rational, and ex-post exactly budget-balanced.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the efficient allocation rule?
		\item Assume $\bar c = \bar v$.  Show that there does not exist a feasible mechanism that implements the efficient allocation rule.
		\item Now assume $\bar v > \bar c$.  Show that the following is a sufficient condition for the existence of a fesible mechanism thatimplements the efficient allocation rule.
		$$ \mathbb{E}(\min\{v_1, v_2\}) \geq \bar c. $$
		\item Again assume $\bar{v} > \bar{c}$, but now suppose that there are $N$ potential buyers with values drawn independently from $F$.  Prove that for any $F$ and $G$ there is a $\bar N$ such that whenever $N > \bar{N}$  there exists a feasible mechanism thatimplements the efficient allocation rule.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\ifsolutions
	\section*{Solution}
%	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label=(\alph*)]
%		\item The efficient allocations must satisfy
%		\begin{align*}
%			q(c,v_1,v_2) = 
%			\begin{cases}
%				(1,0,0) &\text{ if } c > v_1,v_2 \\
%				(0,1,0) &\text{ if } v_1 > c,v_2 \\
%				(0,0,1) &\text{ if } v_2 > c,v_1.
%			\end{cases}
%		\end{align*}
%		Ties can be broken arbitrarily.
%		
%		\item Let's use the Krishna--Perry theorem. The least charitable types are $0$ for the buyers and $\bar{c}$ for the seller. The VCG mechanism with least charitable default types has the following transfers:
%		%
%		\begin{itemize}
%			
%			\item when no trade occurs, there are no transfers
%			
%			\item when trade occurs between the seller and buyer $i$, $i$ pays $v_{-i} \join c$, the seller receives $v_i \meet \bar{c}$, and $-i$ has transfer zero.
%			
%		\end{itemize}
%		
%		When $c=0$ and $v_i > v_{-i}$, trade occurs, with the buyer paying $v_{-i} < \bar{v} =\bar{c}$ and the seller receiving $\bar{c}$. So there is a budget deficit.
%		
%		Since the Krishna--Perry mechanism has maximal revenue among efficient, BIC and IIR mechanisms, this shows that no efficient mechanism is feasible.
%		
%		
%		\item Let's use the same mechanism. The budget surplus is zero conditional on no trade, and
%		%
%		\begin{equation*}
%		[ v_1 \meet v_2 ] \join c - [ v_1 \join v_2 ] \meet \bar{c}
%		\geq [ v_1 \meet v_2 ] - \bar{c} 
%		\end{equation*}
%		%
%		conditional on trade. So the expected budget surplus is bounded below by
%		%
%		\begin{equation*}
%		\E( [ v_1 \meet v_2 ] - \bar{c} | v_1 \join v_2 \geq c )
%		\geq \E( [ v_1 \meet v_2 ] - \bar{c} )
%		\geq 0 .
%		\end{equation*}
%		
%		So the Krishna--Perry mechanism runs an expected budget surplus. By a theorem from class, it follows that there is a feasible efficient mechanism.
%		
%		
%		\item By analogous reasoning, the expected budget surplus is bounded below by
%		%
%		\begin{equation*}
%		\E\left( v^{(2)} - \bar{c} \right) ,
%		\end{equation*}
%		%
%		where $v^{(2)}$ is the second order statistic (the second-highest value). Since $(\bar{c},\bar{v})$ has positive probability under $F$ ($F$ being absolutely continuous), this bound can be made arbitrarily close to $\bar{v} - \bar{c}$ by taking $N$ large enough; in particular, $N$ can be chosen large enough to make it non-negative.
