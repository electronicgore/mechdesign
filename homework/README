All solution files have if-conditions to generate files with and without solutions. Look for lines
\solutionsfalse
\solutionstrue
and comment out the unneeded one.


Headers are currently only present in the versions with solutions.


Problem sets are numbered by topics (numbers of "lectures") in slides, which retrospectively was a bad idea. 


Every problem set has "review questions" which count as "problem 1" in the within-doc numbering and I stuck to this convention. This was a bad idea too.


Many solutions are written by students and are imperfect, but good enough. I edited some but not all parts. Questions themselves are also flawed quite often.
