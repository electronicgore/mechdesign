As such it has hired you to design its new price and servicescheme. There are two types of customers, High-class and Low-class. Theyhave preferences over the fare P and the degree of bad smell in the traincar they ride in, denoted by B. They have told you that they are able tocharge different fares depending on the car a customer rides in (i.e., tohave different classes of service).The type of a customer is not observable; the fraction of high-classcustomers is $\lambda $. Customers' utility functions are $%u_{i}(P,B)=v-\theta _{i}P-B$, for $i=H,L$, where $\theta_{L}>\theta _{H}>0$. All customers get utility (normalized) of 0 fromwalking (their next best alternative) instead of taking the CTA train.Making train cars smell bad is not costless (workers need to be hiredto rub garbage on the seats): the CTA incurs a cost of $\gamma B>0$\per customer who rides in a car that has smell level B.\begin{enumerate}	\item Write down the problem you would solve for determining the CTA's		profit-maximizing scheme. Assume throughout that the CTA cannot charge		negative prices; i.e., that $P\geq 0$. Assume also that the CTA wants		to serve both high and low class customers.		\item Determine the CTA's profit-maximizing scheme. How does it depend		on the parameters of the problem?\end{enumerate}\ifsolutions\subsection*{Solution}\begin{enumerate}	\item Appealing to the Revelation Principle, the CTA's problem can be	written as:%	\begin{align*}		\max_{(P_{L},B_{L})\geq 0,(P_{H},B_{H})\geq 0}  & \Big\{ \lambda (P_{H}-\gamma		B_{H})+(1-\lambda )(P_{L}-\gamma B_{L}) \Big\} \\		\text{s.t. }(IR_{L}) & \quad v-\theta _{L}P_{L}-B_{L} \geq 0 \\		(IR_{H}) & \quad v-\theta _{H}P_{H}-B_{H} \geq 0 \\		(IC_{L}) & \quad v-\theta _{L}P_{L}-B_{L} \geq v-\theta _{L}P_{H}-B_{H} \\		(IC_{H}) & \quad v-\theta _{H}P_{H}-B_{H} \geq v-\theta _{H}P_{L}-B_{L}.	\end{align*}		\item 	\begin{description}		\item Observe first that $(IR_{H})\,$is redundant since it is implied by $%		(IC_{H})$ plus $(IR_{L})$.				\item Observe next that $(IR_{L})$ will bind: otherwise we could raise both $%		P_{L}$ and $P_{H}\,$by some $\varepsilon >0$ and not violate any		constraints, thereby raising profit.				\item Observe next that $B_{H}=0$. If not, then we can lower $B_{H}$ and		raise $P_{H}\,$so that $\theta _{H}P_{H}+B_{H}$ is unchanged. This violates		no constraints (since it raises $\theta _{L}P_{H}+B_{H}),$ but raises profit.				\item Let's ignore $(IC_{L})$ and check that it holds at the end. In this		case, we must have $(IC_{H})$ binding: otherwise we could lower $B_{L}\,$a		little and raise profit. Hence, we see that (by rewriting the binding $IR_L$ and $IC_H$ respectively)		\begin{align*}			P_{L} &=\frac{v-B_{L}}{\theta _{L}}			\\			P_{H} &=P_{L}+\frac{B_{L}}{\theta _{H}} = \frac{v-B_{L}}{\theta _{L}} + \frac{B_{L}}{\theta _{H}}		\end{align*}		So the CTA\ should choose $B_{L}\in \lbrack 0,v]$ to solve 		\begin{equation*}			\max_{B_{L}}\lambda \left( \frac{v-B_{L}}{\theta _{L}} + \frac{B_{L}}{\theta _{H}} \right)+(1-\lambda ) \left(\frac{v-B_{L}}{\theta _{L}}-\gamma B_{L}\right).		\end{equation*}%		This problem is linear, so the solution is to set $B_{L}=v\,$if 		\begin{equation*}			\left( \frac{\lambda }{1-\lambda }\right) \left( \frac{1}{\theta _{H}}-\frac{%				1}{\theta _{L}}\right) -\left( \frac{1}{\theta _{L}}+\gamma \right) >0,		\end{equation*}%		and set $B_{L}=0$ if this inequality is reversed. Note that in the latter		case, we have $P_{L}=P_{H}=\frac{v}{\theta _{L}}$, while in the former case		we have $P_{H}-P_{L}>0.$ (And don't forget to verify that $IC_L$ holds in		both cases.) Also, observe that we are more likely to set $%		B_{L}=v\,$when the fraction of high class consumers ($\lambda $) is high and		the cost of making train cars smelly ($\gamma $) is low. 	\end{description}\end{enumerate}\fi \section{Judicial design}A suspect is in custody, accused of murder.  If he goes to trial he will either be convicted or acquitted. If he is convicted he will be sent to prison for life giving him a payoff of $-1$.  If he is acquitted he goes free and has a payoff of $0$.  The district attorney can offer plea bargains: allowing the defendant to plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence.  In particular, for any $r\in (0,1)$, the DA can offer a reduced sentence which, if accepted, would give the defendant a payoff of $-r.$The defendant is privately informed about his chances for acquittal at trial:  $\theta\in [0,1]$ is the defendant's privately known probability of acquittal.  If the defendant does not enter into a plea bargain with the DA he will go to trial and be convicted with probability $1 - \theta$.Consider the mechanism design problem where the DA is the principal and the defendant is the agent.  A social choice function is a mapping $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \left\{ \text{trial} \right\} \cup (0,1)$ where $f(\theta) = \text{trial}$ means that type $\theta$ will go to trial and $f(\theta) = r \in (0,1)$ means that type $\theta$ accepts a plea bargain giving him a sentence with payoff $-r$. DA thinks $\theta$ has full support on $[0,1]$.\begin{enumerate}	\item Write down the inequalities that characterize whether some given social choice function $f$ is incentive-compatible	for the defendant.	\item What is the set of all incentive-compatible social choice functions?	You can proceed in the following steps:	\begin{itemize}		\item Show that in any IC $f$ at most one plea bargain $r$ is available.		\item Show that $f$ must be of cutoff type, with the suspect taking the plea if $\theta < \bar{\theta}$ and going to court otherwise.		\item Find the value of $r$ that makes the cutoff s.c.f. $f$ incentive compatible given some cutoff type $\bar{\theta}$.		\item Combine all of the above to characterize the set of implementable $f$.	\end{itemize}\end{enumerate}\ifsolutions\subsection*{Solution}By going to trial a defendant of type $\theta$ receives (expected) utility of $-(1-\theta)$, while from accepting a plea bargain his utility is $-r$. %This implies that the IC constraint is $f(\theta)=r \Rightarrow -r\geq -(1-\theta) ~\&~ \forall \theta' \neq \theta ~ f(\theta') \geq f(\theta)$.Fix some s.c.f. $f(\theta)$. Let $\Theta_p$ be the set of types who are offered a plea bargain $f(\theta) = r(\theta)$, and $\Theta_t$ be the set of types who are meant to go to trial: $f(\theta) = \text{trial}$ ($\Theta_t \cup \Theta_p = [0,1]$). Then the IC constraints are given by:\begin{align*}	\text{ for all } \theta \in \Theta_p: \quad&-r(\theta) \geq -r(\theta') \text{ for all } \theta' \in \Theta_p	\\	& \text{and}  -r(\theta) \geq -(1-\theta);	\\	\text{ for all } \theta \in \Theta_t: \quad& -(1-\theta) \geq -r(\theta') \text{ for all } \theta' \in \Theta_p.\end{align*}We will characterize the set of IC social choice functions by a series of claims. \begin{itemize}	\item[claim 1] $f(\bullet)$ has at most one value on the real line.		Proof: if $f(\theta_1)<f(\theta_2) ~\theta_1,\theta_2 \in [0,1]$ then a defendant of type $\theta_2$ gains higher utility by declaring $\theta_1$ (as $-f(\theta_1)>-f(\theta_2)$. This implies the mechanism is not IC for $\theta_2$.		\item[claim 2] $f(\bullet)$ has a cutoff at some $\bar{\theta}$. i.e. $f(\theta)= \begin{cases} r & \text{if } \theta<\bar{\theta}		\\		T & \text{if } \theta\geq\bar{\theta} \end{cases}$ (value at $\bar{\theta}$ is not unique)\\		Proof: assume $\theta'>\theta , f(\theta)=T, f(\theta')=r$. By IC for $\theta$ we know that $-r\leq -(1-\theta)$. However, as $-(1-\theta')>-(1-\theta)$, this implies that $-(1-\theta')>-r$ and we don't have IC for $\theta'$.		\item[claim 3] $r= 1-\bar{\theta}$		Proof: $r\leq 1-\bar{\theta}$ follows directly from IC for type $\bar{\theta}$, while $r\geq 1-\bar{\theta}$ follows from IC of type $\bar{\theta}+\epsilon$. If type $\bar{\theta}$ were strictly better off by accepting the plea bargain, by continuity and monotonicity of benefit of trial, type $\bar{\theta}+\epsilon$ would also strictly prefer the plea bargain, contradicting IC for that type.\end{itemize}These four claims  imply that for any $(r,\bar{\theta})$ s.t. $r= 1-\bar{\theta}$ the social choice function\[ f(\theta)= \begin{cases} r & \text{if } \theta<\bar{\theta} \\		T & \text{if } \theta\geq\bar{\theta} \end{cases} \]is incentive compatible.%As long as the support of types has measure one, the arguments above hold. However, if there is a interval $(a,b)$ with a zero probability, then when we set $\bar{\theta}=a$ any $r\in [a-(b-a),a]$ can be used. This is the case as claim four no longer holds, and we just need to get IC for type $b$. The same argument also holds for closed or half closed intervals.\fi\section{Second-price auction}%MWG 8.B.3 | solutions from Alessandro's questionbankThere is a single item being sold via a second-price sealed bid auction. There are $i={1,...,n}$ bidders. Every bidder $i$ has a private valuation $v_i$, which the other players believe is distributed according to some c.d.f. $F_i(v_i)$. All bidders simultaneously submit bids $b_i$ to the seller (without seeing what the others bid). The highest bidder then wins the object and pays the second-highest bid; all other bidders pay nothing.\begin{enumerate}	\item Show that bidding truthfully ($b_i=v_i$) is a weakly dominant strategy for every bidder $i$.	\item Conclude that the second-price auction implements the efficient allocation rule in dominant strategies.\end{enumerate}\ifsolutions\subsection{Solution}\textbf{Part 1.}Let's prove that for any $v_{i}$and for any $b_{-i}$ bidding $b_{i}\neq v_{i}$ is weakly dominated.There are two cases:\begin{enumerate}	\item $i$ bids $b_{i}>v_{i}$	\begin{enumerate}		\item If there exists $b_{j}>b_{i}$ then $u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})$		\item If $b_{i}$ is the highest bid, let $b_{j}$ be the second highest.		If $v_{i}<b_{j}<b_{i}$ then $u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=v_{i}-b_{j}<0=u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})$.		If $b_{j}<v_{i}<b_{i}$ then again $u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})$.	\end{enumerate}	\item $i$ bids $b_{i}<v_{i}$	\begin{enumerate}		\item If $b_{i}$ is the highest bid, then $u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})$		\item Some other $b_{j}$ is the highest bid. Then if $b_{i}<b_{j}<v_{i}$,		$u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=0$ while $u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})\geq0$; in all		other cases $u_{i}(b_{i},b_{-i})=u_{i}(v_{i},b_{-i})$ 	\end{enumerate}\end{enumerate}Thus, indeed bidding the true value $v_{i}$ is a weakly dominantstrategy.\textbf{Part 2.}The efficient allocation rule $k^*(\cdot) = (k^*_1(\cdot),...,k^*_n(\cdot))$ (where $k_i \in [0,1]$ is the probability that $i$ gets the item) is such that for every profile of valuations $v=(v_1,...,v_n)$: $k^*(v) \in \arg \max_{k(v)} \{ \sum_{i=1}^n v_i k_i(v) \}$. It is easy to see that the efficient allocation rule then prescribes giving the item to the bidder with the highest valuation $v_i$: $k^*_i(v) = \mathbb{I} \{ v_i > v_j \, \forall j \}$ (coupled with any tie-breaking rule). From part 1 we know that the second-price auction has an equilibrium in (weakly) dominant strategies, in which all bidders big truthfully. It is immediate that in this equilibrium, the bidder with the highest valuation wins the item -- i.e., the SPA DS-implements the efficient allocation rule.\fi %%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\end{document}
