\section{Logistics}

\begin{frame}{Hi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Egor Starkov
		\item Contact: \texttt{egor.starkov@econ.ku.dk} or absalon inbox
		\item Research interests: information economics, dynamic games, communication
		\item Office: 26.1.13
		\item Office hours: Tue, 14-15
		\item Questions: email/absalon, before/after class
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Logistics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Weekly lectures (except Fall break -- week \#42)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tue, 15:15-18:00, CSS 2.0.18 (but check timetable for room changes)
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Mandatory assignment:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ``Make your own problem'' -- find an interesting real-world setting and analyze it using the machinery from the class
			\item groups of up to 4 are allowed
			\item deadline: some time in November?
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Final exam:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 24hrs take home (individual, no groups)
			\item Convert problems from text to math; solve them and explain intuition
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Research module for PhD students: contact me if you would like to do it
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Covid-specific stuff}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No online streams/recordings are currently planned, back to stone age
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Materials}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Intended workflow: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item We start a topic in class
			\item \uline{You watch video-lectures at home} during the week (+read textbook, slides, whatever's necessary)
			\item We go through the material \emph{very quickly} in class and discuss any questions you have
			\item We solve some problems in class
			\item You will have more problems to practice at home
		\end{enumerate}
		\pause
		\item Suggestion: organize into groups. Watch lectures in groups. Discuss problems in groups.
		\pause
		\item In class I use whiteboard+slides. Slides on absalon include some of the whiteboard parts.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I'll try to upload slides in advance, but they might be edited and updated afterwards
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{References: textbooks}
	This course is a compilation of many books, papers, courses; does not follow any single one too closely. But here are some books that might help (see the reading list on Absalon for full references)
	\begin{itemize}%[\noitemsep]
		\item \textbf{Narahari}: Probably your best bet. Hard to find in print, but you have online access through the library (see Absalon).
		\item \textbf{Diamantaras}: Another good textbook, but seems very hard to find.
		\item \textbf{B\"{o}rgers}: I used this as default in previous years, but it's quite hardcore and hard to follow. (Easy to find though.)
		\item \textbf{MWG}: A microeconomic bible. Very good, very clear, but has the smallest coverage for our course.
		\item \textbf{RS}: Relevant for two lectures on matching. Some material is contained in Narahari and Diamantaras. Nice reference if you are into matching.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{References: other}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I will sometimes refer to individual papers and surveys for results outside of textbooks.
		\item Some of these are completely optional 
		\item Some I expect you to know (but try to explain well enough in the slides).
		\item See the reading list on Absalon for details (will likely be updated during the course).
		%\item survey papers:
		%\begin{description}
		%	\item[B\&V] Bergemann, Dirk, and Juuso Välimäki. ``Dynamic mechanism design: An introduction.'' Journal of Economic Literature 57.2 (2019): 235-74.
		%	\item[B\&M] Bergemann, Dirk, and Stephen Morris. ``Information design: A unified perspective.'' Journal of Economic Literature 57.1 (2019): 44-95. 
		%\end{description}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%\begin{frame}{References}
%	In the end:
%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\item I suggest getting B{\"o}rgers' textbook. It is not necessary, but might be useful.
	%		\item Diamantaras or MWG are okay alternatives.
	%		\item I do \textbf{not} recommend getting Roth \& Sotomayor textbook unless you are really interested in the topic of matching. Promise the slides will be sufficient for that part of the class.

						\item How to trade things from people who have them to people who value them (in terms of other things they offer in exchange)?
						\item How to allocate the right people to the right jobs?
						\item How to allocate education, healthcare, congestion, ...?
						% Educators' resources are limited and heterogeneous, how to allocate students to schools?

		\item models are abstract but are applicable to a \textbf{lot of} areas (industrial organization, political economy, taxation, auctions\ldots{})
		%\item see course description for more details on what exactly you learn
