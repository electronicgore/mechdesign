\begin{frame}{References}
	In the end:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I suggest getting B{\"o}rgers' textbook. It is not necessary, but might be useful.
		\item Diamantaras or MWG are okay alternatives.
		\item I do \textbf{not} recommend getting Roth \& Sotomayor textbook unless you are really interested in the topic of matching. Promise the slides will be sufficient for that part of the class.

\section{First taste}

\begin{frame}{Example: Environment}
	Let's go back to the apartment sale example and try to tackle the simplest version of it: one buyer, one seller, one item on sale.
	\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \structure<2>{Seller}: likes money, has \textbf{known} valuation $\structure<2>{\bar{\theta}} \in [0,1]$ for the item
		\begin{itemize}[<4>]
			\item \structure<4>{utility}: $u_0(k,t) = t - \bar{\theta} k$
		\end{itemize}
		\item \structure<2>{Buyer}: likes money, has \textbf{private} valuation $\structure<2>{\theta} \in [0,1]$ for the item
		\begin{itemize}[<4>]
			\item \structure<4>{utility}: $u_1(k,t,\theta) = \theta k - t$
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item let \structure<3>{$k \in \{0,1\}$} denote whether the sale occurs
		\item let \structure<3>{$t \in \mathbb{R}_+$} denote the price of the sale (or any other transfer between the buyer and the seller)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Environment comments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $k$ and $t$ constitute the \textbf{outcome} (e.g., $(k,t)=(1,0.5)$ = ``apt sold for 0.5 moneys''). Outcome will, almost always, depend on the buyer's valuation $\theta$. So the object we are interested in is the outcome \emph{function} $(k(\theta), t(\theta))$.
		
		\item For simplicity, allow payments $t$ to be made even if the item is not sold (otherwise better to define $u_0(k,t) = (t - \bar{\theta}) k$ and $u_1(k,t,\theta) = k (\theta - t)$). Also, $t$ that the buyer pays is the same $t$ that the seller receives -- there are no sales taxes, agent commissions, etc.
		
		\item Both players are assumed to be risk-neutral (otherwise utilities are not linear in $t$, which is mildly inconvenient). Obviously, we also ignore everything that does not fit the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility model (including ambiguity/disappointment/loss aversion, regret, prospect theory, etc).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Efficient mechanism}
	Before we go to seller's revenue maximization, suppose policymaker is the designer, wants to facilitate \textbf{efficient trade}.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What does ``efficient trade'' mean?
		\pause
		Efficient = maximizes social surplus: for any $\theta$,
		\begin{align*}
			(k^*(\theta),t^*(\theta)) &\in \arg \max_{k(\theta),t(\theta)} \left\{ u_0(k,t) + u_1(k,t,\theta) \right\}
			\\
			&= \arg \max_{k(\theta),t(\theta)} \left\{ t(\theta) - \bar{\theta} k(\theta) + \theta k(\theta) - t(\theta) \right\}
			\\
			&= \arg \max_{k(\theta),t(\theta)} \left\{ k(\theta) \cdot (\theta - \bar{\theta})  \right\}
		\end{align*}
		\pause
		so $k^*(\theta) = \mathbb{I} \{ \theta > \bar{\theta} \}$ (=trade whenever the buyer values the item more), and $t^*(\theta)$ can be anything.
		\pause
		\item This can be implemented by setting a fixed price $t = \bar{\theta}$. Buyer will then obviously buy if and only if $\theta > \bar{\theta}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Efficient mechanism comments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The irrelevance of price comes from linearity of utilities in $t$, both agents having the same sensitivity to $t$, and the designer assigning same weight to both agents' utilities.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This will be our approach for most of the course -- everyone is equal, so redistribution does not matter; the only goal of transfers is to provide incentives.
			\item In principle, you can factor equality into the problem by adjusting the designer's objective function appropriately.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Optimal mechanism}
	Now back to the original question: what is the sale mechanism that \textbf{maximizes seller's revenue}?
	\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First, what is the realm of all possible mechanisms? What are we choosing from?
		\pause
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Any mechanism produces some outcomes $k,t$
			\item ...though these depend on $\theta$, so they are actually functions $k(\theta),t(\theta)$.
			\item Given these functions, we can always propose a ``direct mechanism'': ``buyer reports $\theta$ to the mechanism, and respective outcomes are implemented.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item But can we choose any pair of functions $k(\theta),t(\theta)$? Or are there any restrictions we should impose?
		\pause
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Well, the idea is for the buyer to report $\theta$ truthfully. So the mechanism should be such that it is optimal for the buyer to report truthfully \alert{$\leftarrow$ ``Incentive compatibility''}
			\item Also, buyer should be willing to participate in the mechanism, as opposed to walking away -- so should get higher utility than what can get by walking away (zero) \alert{$\leftarrow$ ``Individual rationality''}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Optimal mechanism}
	Now back to the original question: what is the sale mechanism that \textbf{maximizes seller's revenue}?
	
	So in the end we get the following problem:
	\begin{align*}
		\max_{k(\cdot),t(\cdot)} & \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ t(\theta) - \bar{\theta} k(\theta) \right]
		\\
		\text{s.t. (IC): } & \theta k(\theta) - t(\theta) \geq \theta k(\hat{\theta}) - t(\hat{\theta}) \text{ for all } \theta,\hat{\theta}
		\\
		\text{(IR): } &\theta k(\theta) - t(\theta) \geq 0 \text{ for all } \theta
	\end{align*}
	\pause
	This is almost a standard maximization problem. Except we're maximizing over \uline{functions}, as opposed to one or two numbers... And there is an \uline{infinite} number of constraints...
	\pause
	Want to know how to solve this? Tune in next week for more mechanism design!

\begin{frame}{For next week}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Watch lectures 2.1 (`What is a mechanism?') and 2.2 (`Dominant strategy implementation')
