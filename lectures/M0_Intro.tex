\begin{frame}{Hi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Egor Starkov
		\item Contact: \texttt{egor.starkov@econ.ku.dk} or absalon inbox
		\item Research interests: information economics, dynamic games, communication
		\item Office: 26.1.13
		\item Office hours: Tue, 14-15
		\item Questions: email/absalon, before/after class
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Logistics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Weekly lectures (except Fall break -- week \#42)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tue, 15:15-18:00, CSS 2.0.18 (but check timetable for room changes)
			\item talk later about what happens in those
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Mandatory assignment:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ``Make your own problem'' -- find an interesting real-world setting and analyze it using the machinery from the class
			\item groups of up to 4 are allowed
			\item deadline: some time in November?
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Final exam:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 24hrs take home (individual, no groups)
			\item Convert problems from text to math; solve them and explain intuition
		\end{itemize}
		
		\pause
		\item Research module for PhD students: contact me if you would like to do it
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Covid-specific stuff}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No online streams/recordings are currently planned, back to stone age
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Materials}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Intended workflow: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item We start a topic in class
			\item \uline{You watch video-lectures at home} during the week (and/or read textbook, slides, papers)
			\item We go through the same material \emph{very quickly} in class and discuss any questions you have
			\item We solve some problems in class
			\item You will have more problems to practice at home
		\end{enumerate}
		\pause
		\item Suggestion: organize into groups. Watch lectures in groups. Discuss problems in groups.
		\pause
		\item In class I use whiteboard+slides for ``lecture'' stuff. Slides on absalon include some of the whiteboard parts.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I'll try to upload slides in advance, but they might be edited and updated afterwards
		\end{itemize}
		The problems will be whiteboard-only; with solutions (mostly) uploaded afterwards.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{References: textbooks}
	This course is a compilation of many books, papers, courses; does not follow any single one too closely. Below are some books that might help (see the reading list on Absalon for full references). Note that notation will be different across books and the class!
	\begin{itemize}%[\noitemsep]
		\item \textbf{Narahari}: Probably your best bet. Hard to find in print, but you have online access through the library (see Absalon).
		\item \textbf{Diamantaras}: Another good textbook, but seems very hard to find.
		\item \textbf{B\"{o}rgers}: I used this as default in previous years, but it's quite hardcore and hard to follow. (Easy to find though.)
		\item \textbf{MWG}: A microeconomic bible. Very good, very clear, but has the smallest coverage for our course.
		\item \textbf{RS}: Relevant for two lectures on matching. Some material is contained in Narahari and Diamantaras. Nice reference if you are into matching.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{References: other}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I will sometimes refer to individual papers and surveys for results outside of textbooks.
		\item Some of these are completely optional 
		\item Some I expect you to know (but try to explain well enough in the slides).
		\item See the reading list on Absalon for details (will likely be updated during the course).
		%\item survey papers:
		%\begin{description}
		%	\item[B\&V] Bergemann, Dirk, and Juuso Välimäki. ``Dynamic mechanism design: An introduction.'' Journal of Economic Literature 57.2 (2019): 235-74.
		%	\item[B\&M] Bergemann, Dirk, and Stephen Morris. ``Information design: A unified perspective.'' Journal of Economic Literature 57.1 (2019): 44-95. 
		%\end{description}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%\begin{frame}{References}
%	In the end:
%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\item I suggest getting B{\"o}rgers' textbook. It is not necessary, but might be useful.
	%		\item Diamantaras or MWG are okay alternatives.
	%		\item I do \textbf{not} recommend getting Roth \& Sotomayor textbook unless you are really interested in the topic of matching. Promise the slides will be sufficient for that part of the class.

			\begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation 2}
	Try to proceed as in game theory, and start by identifying \textbf<1>{players}, \textbf<1>{actions}, and \textbf<1>{payoffs}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause 
		\item \textbf{Players}: \visible<handout:0>{France, Italy at least (+EU as the designer). Can include Monaco and EU (as the funder/claimant). Can separate governments/companies that service rails from companies that operate rolling stock.}
		
		\pause
		\item \textbf{Actions}: \visible<handout:0>{this is tricky. No players' actions, but we have ``outcomes'': whether to build the railway (assume the route is inflexible), how the split the cost, how to split the revenues. Plus we can make direct payments.}
		
		\pause
		\item \textbf{Payoffs}: \visible<handout:0>{depend on outcomes, but also on the total cost of the project, on how much revenue can be collected, how much is generated in indirect benefits...}
	\end{itemize}
	You can already see that we can model this in many different ways, depending on what you consider relevant. What follows is one example, but by no means a definitive solution.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation 3}
Try to proceed as in game theory, and start by identifying {players}, {actions}, and {payoffs}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Players}: \alert{$i \in \{F, I, E\}$} for France, Italy, EU, respectively
	
	\item \sout{Actions} \textbf{Outcomes}: \alert{$k_1 \in \{0,1\}$} whether construction occurs; \alert{$k_{2,i} \in [0,1]$} cost share of $i$; \alert{$k_{3,i} \in [0,1]$} revenue share of $i$; \alert{$t_i \in \mathbb{R}$} extra payment from $i$ to the EU/construction project (can be negative)
	
	\item \textbf{Payoffs}: 
	\begin{align*}
		u_i(k,t,C,R) &= k_1 \cdot \left( B_i + R k_{3,i} - C k_{2,i} \right) - t_i \quad \text{ for } i \in \{F,I\};
		\\
		u_E(k,t,C,R) &= k_1 \cdot \left( B_E + R k_{3,E} - C k_{2,E} \right) + t_I + t_F \quad \text{ for EU as the residual claimant; }
	\end{align*}
	where $C$ is the total cost of, $R$ is the total revenue from, and $B_i$ is the private benefit to $i$ from the rail connection.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation 4}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item But does EU as the designer simply maximize $u_E$?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item More reasonable that it cares about the member states, so the problem is \alert<2>{$\max_{k,t} \{ u_F + u_I + u_E \}$}
			\item equivalent to $\max_{k,t} \{ B_F + B_I + B_E + R - C \}$
		\end{itemize}
		\item If we knew $C, R, B_I, B_F, B_E$, then the problem is trivial: build the rail if and only if $B_F + B_I + B_E + R - C > 0$.
		\item But do we (the EU-designer) know these? Or do the players (the countries) have private information about these?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $B_I, B_F$ are likely players' private info; they probably also have private knowledge about components of $C$ and $R$. Suppose so -- what do we do?
			\item Use payments as incentives to reveal info!
			\item ``If you report high private benefit $B_i$, the rail is more likely to be built, but you'll have to pay more for it.''
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Zoom out}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is effectively the kind of problem we will be thinking about, at least in the first half of the course:
		\begin{exampleblock}{MD problem}
			The designer has some preference over outcomes, which depends on the players' private information. How can the principal elicit this information and select the optimal outcome? 
		\end{exampleblock}
		
		\item \textbf{Assumptions} that we will mostly stick to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Players' \alert{private information} is the main concern.
			\item In particular, players' \structure{compliance} is not an issue; designer has the power to enforce their deicisions.
			\item We will often assume that transfers/payments can be used to provide incentives -- but not always.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Game-theory framework is almost enough for us to work with, but it needs modifications to be useful.
		
		\item Even after setting the problem up, it is not immediate how to approach it with conventional Economic tools -- could use some more specialized solution methods.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{For next week}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Split into study groups (let me know if you are looking for a group)
		\item Read math review notes on absalon
		\item Watch lectures 2.1 (`What is a mechanism?') and 2.2 (`Dominant strategy implementation') on youtube.
		\item Or read Narahari ch.14-16
	\end{enumerate}
