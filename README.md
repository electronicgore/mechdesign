Material and information related to the Masters-level Mechanism Design course at KÃ¸benhavns Universitet.

The course covers most of core topics in mechanism design as presented in Yadati Narahari's textbook, including matching and some bonus topics, such as information design. See the reading list for more detailed info and further readings.

This repo contains lecture slides, homework and exam problems with solutions.

# Changelog:

## 2022:

* Revamped topic 5 (MD without transfers) to drop everything about social choice and add instead a discussion of delegation and cheap talk games. (Part of this discussion will likely be moved closer to the beginning next year.) Old social choice slides are still available in a separate file.

* Added topic 8 (Mechanisms with evidence) to discuss disclosure games and some limited literature on mechanism design with evidence.

* While topic 6 on dynamic mechanisms is still present, I skipped it this year.

* Some regular updates on old slides and problems.
